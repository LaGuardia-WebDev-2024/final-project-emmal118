    <h1>Resume </h1>
My name is Emma and I live in brooklynn nyc. I am a rising senior, intrested in pursuing both music and psycology/english (still deciding!)
    My love for singing comes from being raised in a family full of music; my mom is a clarinet player, my uncle is a composer, my siblings and I grew up playing piano, and more. In 5th grade, I participated in my school production of "the Wizard of Oz", where I portrayed Glinda.
    This was a pivital moment in my life where I realized this is what I truly loved.
    In middle school, I was a part of our all school production of "Into the Woods," where I then portrayed the Baker's wife. 
    During the weekends, I sometimes sing in nuursing homes to volunteer, which I thouroughly enjoy.
    In terms of piano, I started playing classical piano when I was 5, and around 10 years later realised I was sick of classical and decided to try out jazz, which I now still play as well as sing.
    In the future, I truly hope to continue in some sort of a field in music.
